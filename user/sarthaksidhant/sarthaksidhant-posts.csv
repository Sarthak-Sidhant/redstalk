The Real Reason Youtube Removed Dislikes,"Good Morning Redditors! My Very First Post on Reddit! I wanted to say some things about why youtube dislikes are removed, and the real reason behind it, the upcoming things may sound like a conspiracy theory to you and this is just my views regarding it:  **Why Youtube Removed Dislikes?**  Youtube States That It Removed Dislikes As The Dislikes Were Demotivating. What The Corporate Doesn't Understand That The Dislikes Are Visible To The Creator and Creator Will Get Demotivated No Matter What The Reason is If They See Dislikes On Their  Videos. However, As Legit As It Sounds, This Isn't The Real Reason Youtube Removed Dislikes  **What Problem it may result to users?**  The Users Of Youtube Value Quality Content, Quality Content is what liked by the users and has really good like to dislike ratio. In Other Words, A Quality App is One Which is Usually Rated 4+ on the Google Play Store, When Removing The Like To Dislike Ratio, Which Acts As A Rating To The Youtube Video, Youtube Could Slowly **Become Instagram Reels, Or Maybe TikTok**, The Two Social Platforms Usually Don't Feature Dislike Counts and Neither Its Ratio, Which Encourage **The Growth Of Cringe** On These Platforms, These Platforms are just entertainment platforms, Which is That You Don't Get To Choose The Content You Want To Look At, They Are Just Based On **Your Interests**, They Don't Usually Feature Thumbnails And Other Things, Youtube On The Other Hand Does, You Can Actually View Selective Info By Searching Them, Which Brings Us To A Newer Phase Of **Clickbait**. Clickbait is A Lot Easier To Recognise With Comments and The Like to Dislike Ratio, And Usually When The Creator Has Disabled Likes And Dislikes Both, It Signifies That There Was A Lot Of Hatred Depicted Onto This Video, The Disabling Of Comments adds a lot and makes us understand that the content is completely clickbait (though sometimes no). **But After The Removal Of Dislikes Count,** The User Just Sees The Likes Which in Human Psychology Makes it think that the thing is really legit and the tutorial would certainly help him.     **What Benefit Youtube Has In Removing Dislike Counts?**   Youtube Has Many Benefits in Removing The Dislike Counts, The Main Reason is      1. **Money: Believe it or not Youtube is Actually Benefitting Itself Economically By Removing Dislikes Count**: How?    \&gt; **""The User's Psychology Makes It think that the thing is really legit and the tutorial would certainly help him""** \- I said these words When Explaining What Problem It May Cause To The Users, If The Users Views The Complete Video, After Realizing They Just Watched The Complete Video And Wasted Their Valuable Time, They Still Think Why Thousands Of People Had Liked That Video and Question Themselves, They Just **Watched 2 Unskippable Ads For The Video** And Understood The Video Was Not The Tutorial They Were Looking For But The Man Was Just Reading The Entire Script Of The Shrek Movie, This Indeed is Not What Youtube Was Meant For, Youtube Was Meant For Fun, Entertainment, Knowledge, Quality Content, Random Memes, **BUT NOT MEANT TO JUST EARN MONEY AND WATCHTIME THROUGH CLICKBAIT AND CRINGE CREATORS**, This Is Why Jawed Is basically Angry From Youtube. This is a perfectly organized thing, and youtube was like a shrewd all along, not caring about its user's time and sadness but just **MONEY**. 2. **2018: Youtube is Basically Getting Trolled Everyday From The Day Of 2018 rewind Release  on the Topic That The Most Disliked Video On Youtube is Of Youtube itself.** That's The Only Two Reasons I Could Find and Thanks For Listening To My Conspiracy Theories, Or Maybe For Real? I had This Thought While Taking a shower, thinking of dislikes on thumbnails and all, Thankyou Guys! Very First Post!

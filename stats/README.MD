# The `stats` Module in RedStalk

**Overall Purpose**

Think of the `stats` module as your go-to tool for really digging into a Reddit user's activity data and figuring out what's going on ü§î. Its main job is to perform **comprehensive statistical analysis** üìä. It starts with the raw user data ‚Äì usually a JSON file filled with posts and comments, maybe some extra CSVs or user 'about' information. You can tell it to filter the data if you like, then it runs a whole bunch of calculations to measure all sorts of things. Finally, it puts everything together into reports that are easy for a human to read (in Markdown format üìù) and also generates structured data outputs (in JSON format) for machines. It can even put two users' stats side-by-side for comparison ‚öñÔ∏è.

**Key Modules and Their Roles**

Let's break down the different parts of the `stats` module and see what each one does:

1.  **`single_report.py` (The Orchestrator - Single User)** üìã
    *   **Purpose:** This is really the main hub for creating a report for just *one* user. It manages the whole process from start to finish for that single user's analysis ‚û°Ô∏è.
    *   **What it handles:** Well, it starts by taking all your input parameters ‚Äì things like file paths (for the JSON data, any CSVs, where to save the output Markdown and JSON), the user's 'about' info, the username itself, any filtering criteria you've set (like a date range or specific subreddits to focus on or ignore), and calculation settings (like how many top items to show, or N-gram preferences).
        *   **Loads Data:** It reads that primary user activity data right from the specified JSON file (`_load_data_from_json`).
        *   **Applies Filters:** Then, it takes that loaded JSON data and filters it *in memory* based on the date range and subreddit lists you provided (`_apply_filters_to_data`). This gives us the specific dataset we'll actually perform calculations on.
        *   **Orchestrates Calculations:** It's the one that calls the various `_calculate_...` functions over in `calculations.py`. It passes them the *filtered* JSON data or the paths to the corresponding *filtered* CSV files as needed. It pulls all the results back and collects them into a single `stats_results` dictionary.
        *   **Handles Dependencies:** It includes initial checks for optional dependencies (like Pandas or VADER), mainly to log warnings if certain features can't be used. The actual logic and error handling for *using* these dependencies often live within `calculations.py`.
        *   **Orchestrates Reporting:** Once the calculations are done, it calls `reporting._format_report` to turn that `stats_results` dictionary into the nicely formatted Markdown report content.
        *   **Saves Outputs:** Finally, it writes the generated Markdown report to the file you specified and saves the `stats_results` dictionary (cleaned up a bit to remove internal keys) to the JSON file path.
        *   **Returns:** It tells you if it was successful (a boolean) and gives you the calculated `stats_results` dictionary back (which might include some internal info like filter details).

2.  **`calculations.py` (The Engine)** ‚öôÔ∏è
    *   **Purpose:** This module is the real workhorse ‚Äì it's where all the heavy lifting happens for actually figuring out each individual statistic or group of stats.
    *   **What it handles:** Its main job? It's packed with numerous `_calculate_...` functions, each one dedicated to computing a specific metric. We're talking things like `_calculate_basic_counts`, `_calculate_sentiment_arc`, `_calculate_word_frequency`, and many more.
        *   It works with the filtered data it receives (either the in-memory filtered JSON dictionary or paths to filtered CSV files).
        *   This is where the actual math and processing take place, using standard Python libraries (like `collections`, `datetime`, `statistics`, `math`, `re`, `csv`) and those optional dependencies (`vaderSentiment`, `nltk`, `pandas`) if they're available.
        *   It handles checking if you have the optional tools and deals with any potential errors *specifically for the calculations it's trying to do* (for example, making sure `vader_available` is true before attempting sentiment analysis).
        *   The results? It packages them up neatly in a structured dictionary format, ready to be used by `single_report.py` and `reporting.py`.
        *   It's important to note, this module typically *doesn't* handle loading the data from files or formatting the final report itself ‚Äì that's someone else's job!

3.  **`reporting.py` (The Presenter)** üìÑ
    *   **Purpose:** This module is dedicated purely to making the stats look good and easy to read, specifically by formatting them into user-friendly Markdown reports.
    *   **What it handles:**
        *   It has functions specifically for formatting reports: `_format_report` for a single user's stats and `_format_comparison_report` when you're looking at two users side-by-side.
        *   It takes the final `stats_results` dictionary (or two dictionaries plus comparison metrics) as input.
        *   It structures everything nicely into logical sections (like Overall Summary, Content Analysis, Temporal Patterns, and so on).
        *   It knows how to turn data into tables, lists, and even simple text-based charts for temporal data.
        *   The key thing here is it's all about presentation logic, making sure everything is consistent and easy on the eyes.
        *   Crucially, it **does not perform any calculations** itself, and it **absolutely does not use ANSI escape codes**. This ensures the output is clean, standard Markdown that can be read anywhere.

4.  **`comparison.py` (The Comparator)** ‚öñÔ∏è
    *   **Purpose:** As the name suggests, this module is built just for comparing the statistics of two different users.
    *   **What it handles:**
        *   Its job involves taking two pre-calculated `stats_results` dictionaries as input (you'd typically get these from running `single_report.py` without any filters first).
        *   It includes handy helper functions, like `_calculate_subreddit_overlap` or `_compare_word_frequency`, to figure out comparison-specific metrics (like how much their subreddit activity overlaps using a Jaccard index).
        *   It then makes sure the comparison report gets generated by calling `reporting._format_comparison_report`.
        *   And, of course, it saves that resulting comparison Markdown report when it's done.

5.  **`core_utils.py` (The Toolbox)** üõ†Ô∏è
    *   **Purpose:** Think of this as the module's shared toolbox. It contains all those little helper functions and constant values that other modules within the `stats` package might need.
    *   **What it handles:**
        *   It holds all those little helper functions for common tasks, things you need repeatedly.
        *   This includes cleaning up text (`clean_text`) ‚Äì making it lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, URLs, and optionally taking out stop words.
        *   It helps with timestamp stuff (`_get_timestamp`) and making time durations look nice (`_format_timedelta`).
        *   It's also where you'll find the function for generating N-grams (`_generate_ngrams`).
        *   It also keeps track of shared constants, like the `STOP_WORDS` list and ANSI color codes (just remember, these color codes are *only* for logging messages, not for the actual report content!).

**Workflow Summary** ‚û°Ô∏è

Want a quick look at how it all fits together? Here's the basic flow:

*   **Generating a Single User Report:**
    1.  It starts when you call the main function, `single_report.generate_stats_report`, giving it all the necessary inputs.
    2.  Then it loads the user's data from the JSON file.
    3.  Next up, filtering: It sifts through the JSON data based on your criteria.
    4.  After that, it hands things over ‚Äì calling various functions in `calculations.py` using the filtered data or CSV paths.
    5.  The calculation functions do their part, compute all the stats, and send the results back.
    6.  `single_report.py` collects all those results and puts them together.
    7.  It passes the aggregated results to the `reporting._format_report` function.
    8.  The `reporting.py` module takes those results and builds the Markdown text for the report.
    9.  Finally, `single_report.py` saves that Markdown report and, if requested, saves the results dictionary as a JSON file.
*   **Generating a Comparison Report:**
    1.  You call `comparison.generate_comparison_report`, giving it the two pre-calculated `stats_results` dictionaries you want to compare.
    2.  It figures out overlap and other specific comparison metrics.
    3.  It then calls `reporting._format_comparison_report` with the two stats dictionaries and the comparison results.
    4.  The `reporting.py` module creates the Markdown text specifically for the comparison report.
    5.  Finally, `comparison.py` saves that comparison Markdown report.

**Features / Calculated Statistics** ‚ú®

So, what kind of insights does this module actually give you? It digs into the data to provide a really comprehensive picture, covering things like:

*   **Basic Counts:** Total posts, total comments.
*   **Time Range:** First and last activity timestamps.
*   **Account Info:** Creation date, account age (needs `about_data`).
*   **Karma:** Link, comment, total karma (needs `about_data`).
*   **Subreddit Activity:** Posts/comments per sub, unique subs, list of all active subs, diversity measures.
*   **Content & Text:** Word counts, unique words, lexical diversity, average words per post/comment, post types.
*   **Engagement & Scores:** Sum/average scores, distribution, Top/Bottom N scored items, average comments per post, Top N most commented.
*   **Awards:** Total count, items awarded.
*   **Metadata & Habits:** Flair usage, editing frequency/delay, crossposting stats, content removal/deletion estimates.
*   **Temporal Patterns (UTC):** Activity distribution by hour, weekday, month, year; burstiness; account age vs. activity trend.
*   **Simple NLP:** Word Frequency, N-gram Frequency, Sentiment Ratio, Sentiment Arc, Mention Frequency.

**Dependencies** üîó

What does it rely on?

*   **Core:** Standard Python libraries (`os`, `json`, `csv`, `logging`, `time`, `datetime`, `collections`, `statistics`, `math`, `re`).
*   **External (Required by `RedStalk`):** `reddit_utils` (specifically `format_timestamp`, `get_modification_date`, `_fetch_user_about_data`).
*   **Optional (for specific stats):**
    *   `vaderSentiment`: For Sentiment stats.
    *   `pandas`: For reading CSVs efficiently (used in some stats like Question Ratio, Mention Frequency).

**Integration with RedStalk** ü§ù

How does this module fit into the bigger picture of RedStalk? Well, the main `RedStalk` application script is designed to call the `stats` module functions (`generate_stats_report`, `generate_comparison_report`). This usually happens when you tell RedStalk what you want from the command line ‚Äì for instance, using arguments like `--generate-stats` or `--compare-users`. The main script gathers up all the necessary file paths and parameters you provide and then passes them along to the `stats` module functions to do their work.

To wrap it up, the `stats` module is a pretty powerful part of RedStalk üöÄ. It provides detailed insights into user behavior by processing their activity data and presenting the findings in a clear, structured way. It does a good job of keeping the calculation, reporting, and overall workflow logic nicely organized into separate parts.

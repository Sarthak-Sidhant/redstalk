This indicates a willingness to share their knowledge and assist others.

In response to praise for their MS Paint Ghibli artwork, they say, "i wont say i am talented, this was just a one-off thing" (r/indiasocial). This suggests a degree of humility and perhaps some underlying insecurity.
*   **Expressive and Enthusiastic:** The user's language is often expressive, employing intensifiers and interjections to convey their emotions. For example, when complimenting someone's artwork, they say, "thats fucking awesome you are aweosme" (r/indiasocial). They also frequently use emojis and emoticons to enhance their communication.

This reveals a vulnerable side and a fear of the unknown.

In r/TeenIndia, when someone questions the time it took to create the MS Paint artwork, they respond, "are you asking or telling because i dont understand...also if you are asking, this is my first time doing something like this in a haphazard way with a throbbing pain in my index finger joint (amplified by the touchpad) so yeah i tried to rap it up as soon as i could". This suggests a sensitivity to criticism and a need to justify their actions.

This suggests a belief in the importance of human expression and the creative process. They further state in r/indiasocial that "infact a major reason to do this was to find the respect one should have for real artists, this is something that requires patience, and incredible hard work.

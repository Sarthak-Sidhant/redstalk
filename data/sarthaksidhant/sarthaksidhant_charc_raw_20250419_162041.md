        *   Example 1: "basically the title, i am trying to touch type, earlier i was using only 4 fingers, and was getting above 102, and now i am trying to use atleast 8, my left pinkey can't press q, z and x easily or nicely, but i am okay with the speeds i am getting, my right pinkey hurts and pains me a lot though, it stays on the semicolon, and presses it randomly by some very short sensations/jitters/impulses. and i was thinking of keeping it on the p, since thats the only legible use, but that kind of destroys the hand setting, i dont have any ;problem pressing the p key with my other finger, like the ring finger, but the pinkey comes in ;the waay, please shaer tips" - detailed analysis of typing technique and problem-solving.
        *   Example 2: "i know i can add all of them in a cluster, through proxmox, but what purpose does a cluster serve actually? like intuitively it seems to me that they pool resources, but the proxmox cluster i already have doesnt do anything like this - afaik, they appear as different machines doing different jobs, but available from one single dashboard. so this might be a dumb question, but what does a cluster do, how to configure one properly in proxmox, and HOW TO POOL RESOURCES." - shows analytical thinking and problem-solving approach to homelabbing.

knee is making kkrr sound - conspiracy theory,"someone said ""knee is kinda making that kkkrrrrrrrr noise that makes me believe..it needs.. oiling ?? like how doors need oiling ??? but the joint..is kinda .. inside the ..??? wtf ...????"" <br>  <br> \--- <br>  <br> exactly, many people do not realize the fact that in 1871 big oil companies had a meeting at Dubai Trade Center, South California, and THEY FOREVER SHAPED WHAT HUMAN BODIES ARE NOW, and why we need so much oil. <br>  <br> The head of the 2 Biggest Oil companies, General Motors and Hindustan Petroleum, and their heads Johannes Smith and Sunita Williams, were heading the meeting with other powerful world leaders, like Winston Churchil and Adolf Mussolini, and also Mahatma Gandhi   <br>  <br>  <br> and all these world leaders together, they were mad that Oil isn't selling. So they devised a very interesting and powerful plan to sell and keep selling oil forever, They manipuated the very fundamental aspects of the Human Bodies <br>  <br>    <br> and shaped the future for profit and just profit, for big oil corpos.   <br>    <br> They discovered that the Human joint called knee has a fundamental issue, it lacks mobility, so they devised an Anti-body Element, a drug called KB-42 which was an Isomer of Arthrochlorynebutano-phetaminelol <br>  <br> This would get into your knees through your blood stream (it knew where your knees was because proper navigation genes were set it to stop at a hinge joint) and they would weaken and alter the mobility of these hinge joints <br>  <br> Then these big oil corpos claimed that Oil could be used to oil the joints and it seemed very intuitive at first, because Oil and grease was used to mobilize rusty part in auto-machineries, and to keep the joints moving, but these working on human body was unscientific <br>  <br> At that age and time, the oils did nothing, and people got the hint of this being a propaganda, another meeting by big oil corpos (now Tata Motors and Bharat Petroleum) was scheduled in the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, the sweet adobe of Mahatma Gandhi <br>  <br> They decided to equip the Oil with trace amount of Tylenol, The Modern Oils we see today come with Advanced Painkillers. This is also a huge reason why Mahatma Gandhi walked so much because this Oil was first tested on him. and it worked Magically on his old knees <br>  <br> The Modern Oil was now in a fight with modern Medicine Industry because people would now go after Oil instead of medicines, so this man, Henry Ford, grouped both Industries Together, and formed the Idea of Medicinal Oil. <br>  <br> However People were not at ALL satisfied with the bent idea of Medicinal Oil.   <br>    <br> So both of the groups compromised, Medicine Industry would have no instant knee solution   <br>    <br> and the Oil Industry would have less effective Oil, so this would and did cause more people to suffer Knee <br>  <br> I almost forgot to explain how the Oil Industry spread the Knee disease, and how kids are born with Faulty knees, they mixed KB-42 IN ALL WATER RESERVES found over America, Africa and India.   <br>    <br> This drug couldn't get refined in refineries, and was utilized through out the world <br>  <br> People used to drink water infested with the KB-42 Drug, and all of them were soon having Knee Disorder, Countless People were tired of their faulty Knees.   <br>    <br> Work Too Much, Faulty Knees   <br> Work Too Less, Faulty Knees   <br> Get too old, Faulty Knees <br>  <br> This also led to beliefs that significantly led to rise of Atheism, Because how can an All-loving, All-Knowing God, make such Knees that are very faulty in nature, multi-modal faulty, This also led to Protestant Revolutions <br>  <br> But Oil Companies came to the Rescue, the Flavor of Tylenol SIGNIFICANTLY improved the knees. but Needed Constant Tylenol flavor substitution, stop oiling for one day and boom Knee gone <br>  <br> People started worshipping Oil Companies instead, and for their faulty knees, They started applying liters of Oil, which led to a sharp increase in the worldwide consumption of Oil   <br>    <br> Oil Industries flourished in the World War 2 because people,soldiers, all required constant oiling <br>  <br> This is why oil is worshipped even today, a slight decrease in petrol prices is worshipped, LPG is worshipped. Oil runs the world, AND ALSO THE HUMAN BODIES. <br>  <br> Oils today will heal your knee, but only because your ancestors drank KB-42 and supplied the same genetic constructions into their offsprings. This is nothing short of a medical feat, an industry-wide feat. This is great.   <br>    <br> **This is the harm that capitalism causes** <br>  <br> KB-42 was found to be rather ineffecient over time, and hence The Oil we cook with is used to oil our knees, because cook = eat, we eat oil, which has modern KB-42, which we eat, get our knee fucked off and then oil with the same oil which has antedotes to modern KB-42 <br>  <br> It feels like we live in a sophisticated conspiracy. and this is what Adolf Mussolini and Winston Churchill should be blamed for. We need Reconnaisance <br>  <br> **Cheers to the Oil**",/r/copypasta/comments/1jes974/knee_is_making_kkrr_sound_conspiracy_theory/,2025-03-19 08:26:28 UTC,2025-03-19 08:26:28 UTC

Proxmox Virtualization Doubt,"TASK ERROR: KVM virtualisation configured, but not available. Either disable in VM configuration or enable in BIOS. <br>  <br> I have not been able to run VMs for approximately 2 days now. I thought issues were with QEMU that the VM was not booting up, but my dumbass decided to check the logs just now. While on a mobile phone. <br>  <br> I think the way I would be solving this is by enabling Virtualization on my motherboard? In the BIOS. <br>  <br> But this raises a doubt, don't containers count as VMs too? I run 12 containers and all of them seem to work fine, but VMs and only VMs have this issue. <br>  <br> Also if I recall correctly from memory, I did install a NextCloudPi VM through helper scripts, and that seemed to work. Never really touched any thing BIOS after that. I also installed a Ubuntu 24.10 LTS Server using helper scripts and that crashed midway because I pressed Ctrl + D by mistake. <br>  <br> And only now was I thinking of running VMs after all my containers seem to work fine enough. <br>  <br> Please let me know if I am Hallucinating or something ",/r/homelab/comments/1j5sg3e/proxmox_virtualization_doubt/,2025-03-07 16:22:32 UTC,2025-03-07 16:22:32 UTC
how to transcode with Ryzen APU in proxmox,"Hi! I recently configured a Media server with the \*arr stack in proxmox, it uses jellyfin to serve the media to the end user. It runs great with H264 High, However, when I playback HEVC encoded media, it is an issue. The Frames drop to 9fps. <br>  <br> i have a Ryzen 3200G APU which has a Vega 8 iGPU, I also have an GT 710 2GB DDR3 to throw in but I believe my current Vega 8 is WAYY better than a GT710 (based on user bench marks, it was like 200% better) <br>  <br> as far as i understand, I need iGPU passthrough and then transcoding. I tried finding some tutorials but all of them were about Intel iGPUs <br>  <br> I found this tutorial that lets me use an [AMD GPU in Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/amd/).  <br>  <br> However, I don't know or understand how to passthrough my iGPU to proxmox. <br>  <br> I don't mind the extra power the iGPU consumes, because it would be far less than adding a GT 710 (i think) <br>  <br> Any and All help would be appreciated, Thanks. <3",/r/homelab/comments/1j3v5wf/how_to_transcode_with_ryzen_apu_in_proxmox/,2025-03-05 04:43:22 UTC,2025-03-05 04:43:22 UTC

how to cctv in homelab,"hi, i have a small homelab, with a non-poe 24 port gigabit switch and 3 nodes that run proxmox. <br>  <br> i wanted to set up a surveilance system in my homelab, something that can keep records of upto 1-2 months, via 3-4 video channels / cameras; <br>  <br> since all the cameras are indoor cameras, i would be using something like 2MP/3MP Cameras, The Cameras I wanted to buy these [TP Link VIGI](https://amzn.in/d/awMWYpb) or it's alternatives like [Sinloe 5MP](https://amzn.in/d/2kjB1Gm). <br>  <br> *I was also eyeing a* [*2mp cctv camera* ](https://www.cpplusworld.com/products/network-camera/2-mp)*from CP Plus, but this brand doesn't really say anything about ONVIF support, and offers ""HD"" or Analog Cameras (im assuming)* <br>  <br> As far as I understand, I should be looking for ONVIF support - I am assuming?? and not ""HD"" Cameras but only and only IP Cameras Specifically? <br>  <br> Since I do not want to use an NVR/DVR, i would have to configure some surveilance software on my proxmox node itself, and then connect all my cameras to the Switch. and Then Power Them Externally. <br>  <br> I have enough storage in my Proxmox Node (Assuming 3TB should be enough). <br>  <br> some other requirements are: 720 to 1080p videos, with ATLEAST 15 fps, real time video monitoring too. <br>  <br> **Some of My Questions Are:**   <br> 1. Should I host it as a virualized environment in my proxmox node? if yes what specs, if no what type of system are we looking at? what specs again. <br>  <br> 2. Some Outdoor Cameras I was seeing have this 2-way audio feature, and I might want to use that, so can that be configured?  <br>  <br> 3. What Features am i potentially giving up if I am not choosing an NVR? <br>  <br> 4. What Camera Hardware should I look for? eg. IP and ONVIF <br>  <br> 5.

Classmate said Secularism destroys Identity,"We were supposed to give speeches in school today, on any random topic. <br>  <br> Classmate chose 'Secularism', and in the same style as JSDeepak, gave a speech on how Secularism, makes you not care about religion, and hence makes you Atheists. When you become Atheists, you disregard your culture, and roots. You don't respect them enough. He expressed how he respects all Religions followed by Human Beings but doesn't respect Seculars. <br>  <br> The English teacher Intervened, and expressed his views on the topic, and asked others who'd rather be called as Seculars than being called a Hindu or a Muslim. And Hence doesn't destroy the Religious Roots one belongs to. <br>  <br> I intervened too, and asked the classmate, about what was his definition of Secularism. For him, Secularism means not caring about one's religion, to the extent of not caring about Your Cultural and Religious Roots. <br>  <br> ""And that makes you atheist, which leads you to forget and disrespect you culture, your identity"", the Classmate said. <br> I define Secularism as a philosophy that Religion in general, should not Influence the way we normally function in Society. Religion is a very small, a very personal thing, and keeping it ahead of the Society we live in in order of priority), or the way we function. <br>  <br> When I call myself Secular, I firmly believe that Religion should not intertwine or influence Governance or Politics in general, I firmly believe that Religion should also not influence Educational, Thoughts, Rationality. <br>  <br> Another Important Personal Perspective is that someone being from a specific religion won't make me biased or influence my perception towards them, negatively or positively. (However, the same doesn't apply to the philosophies they believe in) <br>  <br> Because in this society, there is much more than things like Religion. <br> When you're an atheist, you're not necessarily forgetting your Cultural roots, or your Identity, or the Lineage you come from, you're just rejecting the idea of god. A mysterious spaghetti monster. That's it. <br>  <br> Questioning your Culture and having a more liberal approach and not being fundamental towards the principles of your culture is entirely a different things. Infact some may believe that Culture is not at all important, and it is absolutely their choice to do so. <br>  <br> I am not bound to follow the stupid norms and traditions, developed by my culture. People's Rudimentary Approach to Culture Causes Conflict. <br>  <br> You define culture, Society Defines Culture. Religion is smaller than culture, a very small aspect of culture, I must say. <br>  <br> Sure Religion has Influenced Culture, because of certain grouped beliefs, but that doesn't mean you link both of them directly. <br>  <br> Religion is for Culture and Culture is NOT for Religion. <br>  <br> That is secularism. Keep your religion to yourself, Keep your culture to yourself, Keep your beliefs to yourself. Don't let that define the current governance or Political Scenario. <br>  <br> Culture has evolved through times, Society has Evolved through time, Today's Society is tomorrow's Culture, but Religion hasn't, still stuck in Rudimentary Past with age old beliefs. <br>  <br> People can and have coexisted together in this Society, Your Religion doesn't dictate what or how beautiful your Culture Was. <br> I want to know your views on Culture, Identity and Secularism. <br> --- <br> Other funny way of thinking about Atheism and Culture Together is: <br> ""I don't think batman is the superior god, But I like his Philosophy, I like his principles. I love the Architectural Design at Gotham. I love gothams culture"" <br>  <br> Or <br> ""Hogwarts is cool, I am a gryffindor, yes stories about spells and potion and the magical world are sure, fantasy, I don't believe in Dumbledore, but I love the culture and the roots of the tree where we hanged snape"" <br>  <br> Or Something something lmao <br> - <br>  <br> ""Call me Secular the way I hate all religions"" <br>  <br> -- Sun Tzu (He Never Said this but I still needed to place this quote somewhere because funny) <br>  <br> I attached an Image because funny <br>  <br> I did this on a 'discussion flair' and my post got removed.

I think I did an oopsie - Help,"Hi there homelabbers! <br> So I imported an X99 FD4 Motherboard, Dual CPU with 128 GB RAM and 2x E5 2686 V4 (36 cores 72 threads) with 2x 512 GB NVMe SSD and 3TBx4 and 1TBx4 of HDD (the motherboard has 8 SATA ports.) It has a GbE (I think should not be a problem as my router has a switch). I also got a GT710 2GB DDR3 with it. <br>  <br> I am not sure about the quality but considering this is from a genuine seller on Alibaba, I am genuinely hoping I don't get scammed. <br>  <br> For the Price being around 450 USD, I think it was a pretty great price.  <br>  <br> The Only problem is: <br>  <br> 1. I don't have any experience with Dual CPU motherboards - I've heard they are like really silly and sometimes have some PCIe Nuisance (some stuff wont work) But I have also heard they are great at computing. <br>  <br> 2. I have some experience with a home server but I have never really wanted to do a lot of things at once. <br>  <br> With this project, I aim to seed atleast 6 TB of Torrents, While using 6TB for datahoarding and backups and the rest 4 as a fast NAS. While Leveraging the Computational Power to continuously run Python Scripts and geek around. While of course running the casual homelab stuff Like Plex, Home Assistant, Ad DNS, Minecraft server and casual stuff like that. I want to retire my current homelab which I don't really use. <br>  <br> 3. My Next Problem is the Case, I have heard hard disks are really fragile and vibration problems, so I need a case, I can't find any that could fit 8 3.5 Inch Hard Disks. <br>  <br> 4. What Power Supply shall I Use?and what cooling shall be necessary. <br>  <br> 5. What steps should I do to make sure I am getting the right material - Like checking my hard disks health and etc <br>  <br> 6. I have a 200 Mbps Internet Connection and little to almost no knowledge about networking. Also I am very new to the server scene <br>  <br> Your Guidance would be sincerely appreciated <br> Thanks",/r/homelab/comments/1hpzcr8/i_think_i_did_an_oopsie_help/,2024-12-30 22:26:45 UTC,2024-12-30 22:26:45 UTC

the notes of 2023-24 for class 10 // drive download // dps boaro,"hello, so last year when i was just a kid and in class 10th, at dps bokaro, i made a website to publish the notes of my school, classwise and teacherswise, <br>  <br> in like the last year, the site amassed huge numbers, from both the school and outside the school. hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the notes. <br>  <br> i stopped keeping this project updated when i left the school, however!! i believe due to boards being close and preboards closer, i believe all of you are going through your notes and books. <br>  <br> some subjects like english and hindi are not updated and might not be updated - any sooner or later, but i believe they may help in your revision, the best notes to learn are probably of SST and Science, so go ahead and score good marks. <br>  <br> this is the [website](https://dpsbk.click/classes/class10.html), you can navigate and select what teachers <br>  <br> more advised way would be the [class 10 - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhPrIvyvubndE3ZjgrNAMUyCwsqvGWKz) link, where you can select certain notes from certain teachers. <br>  <br> here are some good teacher recommendations:   <br>  <br>  <br> for detailed history, go with rachna ojha maam notes, and for quick one pointers, go with ranjana jha mam's notes, do the same for political science. <br>  <br>    <br> for geography, you have two options and i would ask you to go through both of them, i cant really have an opinion here, but you should try nimisha mam's notes, i have also provided the map pointing thingie <br>  <br> for econ, go with sushmita mam's notes, and study from the ""assignments"" tab too <br>  <br> for physics, go with ravi prakash dwivedi sir's notes <br>  <br> for bio, rita khawas mam's notes are top tier <br>  <br> for chem, go with sulekha mam's notes <br>  <br>    <br> they might help, they might not, goodluck for your boards! <br>  <br>    <br> also---> you should try the same with your school, the next year, your school deserves a platform for the students to share their notes, and it is very very important. i am trying to make one for all schools country-wide, get in contact through reddit if you're good with python or web-apps, let us make some great project together. <br>  <br>    <br> cya goodluck for preboards and baords, dont be stressed <br>  <br>    <br> ",/r/CBSE/comments/1h9fs1j/the_notes_of_202324_for_class_10_drive_download/,2024-12-08 10:06:49 UTC,2024-12-08 10:06:49 UTC

criticising one's belief should be normalized,"when people mix together, criticize and discuss solutions and problems, it leads to a better mind. <br>  <br> but in a secular country, when a leader criticizes a religion, it becomes a problem. <br>  <br> why? possibly because of the responsibility they have?   <br> and also because people misinterpret criticism and peddle their hateful and bigoted propaganda. <br>  <br> insulting a religion is a crime in india, and i think it should be the way it is.   <br> but criticism is important, and is an inhrent nature of human beings. <br>  <br> so where do we draw the line between criticism and insulting, and would the common masses understand? <br>  <br> why can't a leader do it? <br>  <br> i would like to have your views on this topic",/r/atheismindia/comments/1gj42ow/criticising_ones_belief_should_be_normalized/,2024-11-04 02:28:51 UTC,2024-11-04 02:28:51 UTC

What Use Can I Put My Building into,"I have a 4-floored building (almost 8500 square feet in total) at Sankat Mochan Colony, on the Heart Hospital Road, 500m from the Renowned Atithi Family Restaurant at Madhubani, Bihar. <br>  <br> The building has 3 2BHK flats with dual bathrooms a parking for motorbikes, and 2- 800 sqft hall and 1700 sqft hall and a 1700 sqft roof with bathrooms for each hall. <br>  <br> I am not from Madhubani, and so I have no Idea of what I shall utilise my building for.

"just an update, on my current life","I'm 16ish, Male, and tomorrow is my english boards exam.   <br> On 22nd, my father passed away. It was not expected by anyone. He was the fittest person I knew in my life, on 21st, after giving my hindi exam, I returned home and slept the entire day. In the night, i was awake and fresh, learning some biology, and my father was complaining that he was not able to breath, this was not a usual thing, but in the recent days (19th), he had fallen a little bit sick, and over dosed on some medicines, like disprin, sarbyna strong and paracetamol to have some relief, and was coughing, he was alright though, but he felt the chest tightness in night on the 21st and was fighting his hard to stay alive, unknownst to him.   <br> i was helping him through every moment from midnight to 3-4 pm, whether it be preparing an ayurvedic treatment i took for cough or with an allopathic general medicine for respiratory problems, before this, he usually never used medicines for any purposes. by 6 and 7, his situation got worse, he still complained about the chest tightness and there was nothing we could do, he was against hospitals because his brother-in-law (my uncle-in-law) and mother (my grandmother) both died even though there health seemed recoverable. <br>  <br> by 7 we had to go to the hospital, and therefore we chose a govt hospital, because according to my father, they were less greedy. we visited the hospital, he was given oxygen, his blood pressure was high, they gave him some medicines, and everything went back to normal, i held the nebulizer in my hands and he had the medicines with it. then soon after it, the attendant at the govt hospital asked my mother to go to BGH, bokaro general hospital, because my father's condition did slightly improve, but they couldn't diagnose the problem, and they feared it could be heart's issue. <br>  <br> by 9, we arrived at BGH, with an ambulance provided by sadar, the govt hospital. BGH was the place my father dreaded of the most, he was taken into a stretcher and an attendant who seemed like a 30ish year old person learning medical stuff, and he was screaming at my father why a person capable of being on a wheel chair had to use a stretcher, i dont know but i did not like his attitude, then they took my father to casualty ward first, where they did an ECG on him, and they said to me that he had a heart attack, I was genuinely horrified, he was the fittest man i knew, so chances of his artery being blocked was against my belief. BGH immediately transported him to the CCU where he was seeing the words on the door, and my soul pains, when i think that the last words or thing he probably saw was ""Critical Care Unit"" then, he was placed on a ventilator and sedated, and as per my belief, a person should be next to take care of him, we were in the hospital till 1:45, with my mother, worried. the doctors did declare this was a heart attack, they suggested us to book cardiac ambulance. they said that the condition was alright, and he was just on ventilator for oxygen support. everything was great, his spo2 was 90%, he was having an okay heart rate, he was looking recoverable. <br>  <br> if this was the case and chest tightness and sweating was a symptom of heart attack, then quite literally, he was having a heart attack **the whole night**. and if thats true, then I am proud of my father for being so strong, and not openly expressing his pain, to worry us. to worry me, during my boards. <br>  <br> we booked a cardiac ambulance from medica hospital, ranchi. they recommended an angiology, and then asked us to carry on with what the hospital said and surely it would cost a lot, about 3 lakhs, but it was nothing compared to price of saving my father's life. by 1:45 we went home to pack for ranchi, i decided to stay at home in bokaro, to study for my boards, as i wanted to make my father proud after he arrived home, fit and fine. <br>  <br> about an hour later, by 2:45, i was in home, relaxing a bit, and then i started feeling this shrieking pain in my heart, i didnt know how it felt or what it meant, but by 3 it grew, i called my relative and he said that my father had a second heart attack, the condition was not stable, my mother should go visit him. <br>  <br> by the time we reached hospital, my relative shook his head, we understood what it meant, and started crying our hearts off. i was genuinely shocked, i broke the CCU barriers to visit my father and saw the straight line, and then i just started beating myself and allat. i was angry, for i dont know what reason. then i controlled my mother, by doing my best, we arrived at my home, it was all over in the newspaper, my father was an eminent educationalist of bokaro, and he had about 49000 students registered in colleges for their graduation or masters through him, basically a career counsellor, but with guidance, academic help, and scholarship services. <br>  <br> i have my boards, and therefore i was not the one doing the antim sanskar of my father, but my younger brother is doing it, and i am helping him through every way. <br>  <br> my life goal is now to complete my father's dreams. <br>  <br> wish me luck",/r/u_SarthakSidhant/comments/1azmyae/just_an_update_on_my_current_life/,2024-02-25 12:37:49 UTC,2024-02-29 20:42:31 UTC

Someone make a Keybind to switch apps in the Cardputer !!,"Hi, a small little request, I don't know if it would be hard or not, I just want the developer kings (people smarter than me) to develop a home screen for the Cardputer, just a home screen that displays time.  <br>  <br> But it has a secret 'keybind-switch' enabled that works like this: <br>  <br> It tracks for keys to be pressed, say if R was pressed, it would start recording and if M was pressed it would start ESP-NOW app, and if T was pressed it would start a timer. Press H and you are at the help page looking to set more Keybinds for more app/menus <br>  <br> I think it would save the hassle of using the teeny-tiny keyboard to repeatedly switch apps <br> And just generally using the arrow keys. <br> Press a button and you're good to go <br>  <br> Plus people who come across it wouldnt know how to use it making it secure. <br>  <br> PS: I'm not trying to act as a spoiled brat asking you to work on my ideas, I am just handing out a suggestion that I think is good enough and simple enough to work on. I would love to work but my Cardputer hasn't arrived yet and would love some progress, I also don't have any idea how to execute this idea and would like your help to know in which direction I should move towards.

The Real Reason Youtube Removed Dislikes,"Good Morning Redditors! My Very First Post on Reddit! I wanted to say some things about why youtube dislikes are removed, and the real reason behind it, the upcoming things may sound like a conspiracy theory to you and this is just my views regarding it: <br>  <br> **Why Youtube Removed Dislikes?** <br>  <br> Youtube States That It Removed Dislikes As The Dislikes Were Demotivating. What The Corporate Doesn't Understand That The Dislikes Are Visible To The Creator and Creator Will Get Demotivated No Matter What The Reason is If They See Dislikes On Their  Videos. However, As Legit As It Sounds, This Isn't The Real Reason Youtube Removed Dislikes <br>  <br> **What Problem it may result to users?** <br>  <br> The Users Of Youtube Value Quality Content, Quality Content is what liked by the users and has really good like to dislike ratio. In Other Words, A Quality App is One Which is Usually Rated 4+ on the Google Play Store, When Removing The Like To Dislike Ratio, Which Acts As A Rating To The Youtube Video, Youtube Could Slowly **Become Instagram Reels, Or Maybe TikTok**, The Two Social Platforms Usually Don't Feature Dislike Counts and Neither Its Ratio, Which Encourage **The Growth Of Cringe** On These Platforms, These Platforms are just entertainment platforms, Which is That You Don't Get To Choose The Content You Want To Look At, They Are Just Based On **Your Interests**, They Don't Usually Feature Thumbnails And Other Things, Youtube On The Other Hand Does, You Can Actually View Selective Info By Searching Them, Which Brings Us To A Newer Phase Of **Clickbait**. Clickbait is A Lot Easier To Recognise With Comments and The Like to Dislike Ratio, And Usually When The Creator Has Disabled Likes And Dislikes Both, It Signifies That There Was A Lot Of Hatred Depicted Onto This Video, The Disabling Of Comments adds a lot and makes us understand that the content is completely clickbait (though sometimes no). **But After The Removal Of Dislikes Count,** The User Just Sees The Likes Which in Human Psychology Makes it think that the thing is really legit and the tutorial would certainly help him.   <br>  <br>  <br> **What Benefit Youtube Has In Removing Dislike Counts?**  <br>  <br> Youtube Has Many Benefits in Removing The Dislike Counts, The Main Reason is    <br>  <br>  <br> 1. **Money: Believe it or not Youtube is Actually Benefitting Itself Economically By Removing Dislikes Count**: How?    <br> \> **""The User's Psychology Makes It think that the thing is really legit and the tutorial would certainly help him""** \- I said these words When Explaining What Problem It May Cause To The Users, If The Users Views The Complete Video, After Realizing They Just Watched The Complete Video And Wasted Their Valuable Time, They Still Think Why Thousands Of People Had Liked That Video and Question Themselves, They Just **Watched 2 Unskippable Ads For The Video** And Understood The Video Was Not The Tutorial They Were Looking For But The Man Was Just Reading The Entire Script Of The Shrek Movie, This Indeed is Not What Youtube Was Meant For, Youtube Was Meant For Fun, Entertainment, Knowledge, Quality Content, Random Memes, **BUT NOT MEANT TO JUST EARN MONEY AND WATCHTIME THROUGH CLICKBAIT AND CRINGE CREATORS**, This Is Why Jawed Is basically Angry From Youtube. This is a perfectly organized thing, and youtube was like a shrewd all along, not caring about its user's time and sadness but just **MONEY**. <br> 2. **2018: Youtube is Basically Getting Trolled Everyday From The Day Of 2018 rewind Release  on the Topic That The Most Disliked Video On Youtube is Of Youtube itself.** That's The Only Two Reasons I Could Find and Thanks For Listening To My Conspiracy Theories, Or Maybe For Real? I had This Thought While Taking a shower, thinking of dislikes on thumbnails and all, Thankyou Guys! Very First Post!

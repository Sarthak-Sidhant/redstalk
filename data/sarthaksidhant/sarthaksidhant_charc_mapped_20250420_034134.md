### 8. Creative Summary (Archetype)

*   **Idealism vs. Cynicism**: The user expresses idealistic views about social justice and the importance of human creativity, yet also displays a cynical and sarcastic attitude towards the world.
* **Appreciation for real artists, yet uses tracers** - The user says "hey no it is alright, also - i did use tracers, to try to get a perfect outline, but it didn't have the studio ghibli feel, and hence the haphazard black tracing. and i think that's what make it look raw." but also says that "infact a major reason to do this was to find the respect one should have for real artists, this is something that requires patience, and incredible hard work. People should understand, that sure, AI eases some things, but can you really call it art when an Image Generator has made it for you? When you have not contributed anything to the process?"
* **Against AI art, but uses tracers** - The user is against AI art, but uses tracers. They are against AI art because "AI text, or AI art lacks character, because you are effectively dissolving your creativity, and you are putting the ability to enjoy the process on the line, because you only care for the end result, and this is what disrespects real artists, you think of their art as something that holds meaning only when it is finished. again, Art is subjective, but for me, it is something you should be fulfilled with, and have your creativity embedded in it." but they use tracers, to create a perfect outline.

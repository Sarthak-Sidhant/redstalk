"A very long list of [Hindu terrorism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_terrorism) <br>  <br> for starters, a very common and easy to remember name would be Nathuram Godse <br>  <br> Thank You!",/r/atheismindia/comments/1jfuaqm/hindu_to_hinsak_hota_hi_nahi_nahi_hai_sab/mitwxd0/,2025-03-20 17:37:43 UTC,2025-03-20 17:37:43 UTC
"Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me. <br>  <br> Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet. <br>  <br> That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. <br>  <br> Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make: <br>  <br> lol",/r/librandu/comments/1jfs41u/my_sanghi_friend_trolls_me_coz_i_read_in_pvt/mitw7vo/,2025-03-20 17:34:24 UTC,2025-03-20 17:34:24 UTC

"hi!! thank you so much for your input, it means a lot. <3 <br>  <br> when i meant an NVR, i meant a dedicated NVR. <br>  <br> Yeah, Frigate is awesome, it is crazy how they do this all locally <br>  <br> also, i can't really add a GPU (except one Gt710 ddr3 2gb), or a TPU, so I am assuming frigate works fine without that, because tbh i don't want any detection system. I have thought of going with a TP-Link, a HikVision, a Dahua and a Sinloe. all of these cameras combined would cost me less than 80$ and would help me test each with frigate. <br>  <br> and a PoE - 5 port at 1gbps is double the price of 100mbps, so i am not really interested in PoE switches, because i have ports all over my house and i can just power them normally. <br>  <br> so yep thats it and thank you so much for taking out the time to write this  <br>  <br> really appreciate that",/r/homelab/comments/1ivhsri/how_to_cctv_in_homelab/me607z9/,2025-02-22 14:14:39 UTC,2025-02-22 14:14:39 UTC

"Four Mahakumbh pilgrims were killed and thirteen got injured in a road accident on the Kanpur-Prayagraj Highway on Wednesday. They were going to the Maha Kumbh Mela to take the holy dip on the occasion of the Magh Purnima. The fatal road accident took place in the Bindki area of ​​Fatehpur district on Wednesday morning. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> A travel bus carrying 21 pilgrims from Uttam Nagar in Delhi to Prayagraj collided from behind with a dumper near Dudhi Kagar turn in the Kalyanpur police station area on Kanpur-Prayagraj Highway. In this accident, four people, including the bus driver died on the spot, while 13 other passengers were injured. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  <br> According to eyewitnesses, the accident was so terrible that the dumper dragged the traveler bus for about two-and-half kilometers. Immediately after the accident, there was a lot of screaming at the spot.  At the same time, 13 people were seriously injured. All the injured were sent to the district hospital by 108 ambulances where all the injured were undergoing treatment. <br>  <br> The dumper driver pulled the bus stuck in the dumper carelessly. This accident happened on Wednesday at around 5:00 am near Dudhi Kagar turn. <br>  <br> According to the police, all the people on the traveler bus were going to take bath in the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. In the accident, bus driver Aman Chaudhary, passengers Anoop Jha, Rukmani Chaudhary and Vivek died on the spot. 13 injured have been sent to the district hospital from PHC Gopalganj for treatment. The condition of many of the injured is said to be critical. <br>  <br>    <br> Source: [4 Mahakumbh pilgrims killed, 13 injured after bus collides with truck on Kanpur-Prayagraj Highway – India TV](https://www.indiatvnews.com/uttar-pradesh/4-mahakumbh-pilgrims-killed-13-injured-after-bus-collides-with-truck-on-kanpur-prayagraj-highway-2025-02-12-975854)",/r/kanpur/comments/1iq8los/relatives_were_heavily_injured/mcy2iu4/,2025-02-15 19:06:43 UTC,2025-02-15 19:06:43 UTC
